Simple install procedure
========================

   % tar -xzvf iuutool-x.y.z.tgz   # unpack the sources
   % cd iuutool-x.y.z              # change to the toplevel directory
   % make                          # build 

Invocating make should build the library and some executables for
testing in the test/ directory. Take a look at the source code in
order to start using iuutool. There are also examples on how to use it
with Tcl/Tk in the lib/tcl/ directory.

This release contains SWIG bindings for Tcl/Tk. That means that if you
don't have them installed in your system, you will get compilation
errors. Should that happens do not panic. Go to lib/tcl, edit Makefile
and follow the instructions. Uncommenting a specific line will solve
your problems.
