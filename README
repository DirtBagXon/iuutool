General Information
===================

iuutool is a port of the WB Electronic's SDK for their Infinity USB
Unlimited (iuu for short) smart card reader plus some samples and utility
code. Besides that it also provides you with the functionality of the
good and old nftytool for programming AVR and PIC cards using the iuu.


Installation
============

See the file 'INSTALL'


iuutool utilities: iuuterm
==========================

The iuuterm is a terminal for communicating with the IUU. Run it from
the command line and call for the device detection and initialization
routine:

start

Then you can for instance fetch the IUU firmware version by issuing
the following commands: 

write 01
read 04

For the product name you can use:

write 02
read 16

And for the loader version:

write 50
read 04

For the status register I would try:

write 03
read 01

Setting the LED is easy:

write 04 00 00 00 40 00 00 ff

Setting the on-board frequency generator too:
sf 3579000

You can get serious by start using the phoenix mode... :
write 49 02 98 01

... changing its settings:
write 5e 02 02 98 01

... reseting the card ... :
write 52 06 10 53

... reading the card ATR length response from the phoenix UART:
write 56
read 1

... and reading the complete ATR response (n is the last number you got):
read n


The source code for the SDK port is include/wbeiuu.h and lib/wbeiuu.c


Using iuutool with Tcl/Tk
===========================

This release includes SWIG binding for Tcl/Tk if you are into high
level scripting languages. IMHO they provide a better solution for
building applications like iuuterm above. I would have added Python
and PERL bindings but I lack the experience to provide a tidy and
elegant solution, at least from the same swig interface file. If you
want to give me a hand with that it will be great. 


Demos using Tcl/Tk are in the lib/tcl/ directory. They include a clone
of the LED.exe application available in the original SDK by WB
Electronics. It is an excellent proof of concept when it comes to show
how little script code can do the same than a hundred lines of low
level language.
