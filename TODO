- WBE's SDK INFUNLTD_Read() has two different parameters:
  bytes_to_read and bytes_actually_read. We don't and I wonder if that
  is going to be a problem in the long run.
  (Actually, it is: It is a shortcoming of libusb. Among other
  annoyances you can read from the iuu when there is nothing to
  read and no error is reported)

- infinity_get_ep_descriptor() should process properly
  USB_ENDPOINT_IN|OUT

- All phoenix operations must be carried out after checking that the
  IUU is in Phoenix mode.

- the check 'if (!CheckSDKInput (hDevice))' at the original Win32 SDK
  code is a handy function to ckeck the call integrity.

- a 'char buffer[256]' as part of the iuu_device_handle would provide
  encapsulation among other things like buffering.

- Fishy usb_control_message (parm switch) for CTS
